   Program description: This program allows the user to see the grayscale and blurred (portrait mode) version of the image.
                        User can switch between the effects (original, gray scale, portraitMode) by clicking mouse button. 
                        There is a portrait mode effect which focuses on the face of the middle dog and blurs every other pat of the image.
                        This effect has specific calculations for the provided image (dogs.jpg) only. If the user simply want to blur the image,
                        they can do that by removing the if condition in line 64.
   
   Usage Instructions: On starting the program, original image shows up. Then, on clicking anywhere on the canvas, gray scale image shows up,
                       and on clicking again, the blurred (portrait mode) image shows up, and then again, the original shows up, and so on.
