### Image Gray Scale and Portrait Mode Effects

Program description: This program allows the user to see the grayscale and blurred (portrait mode) version of the image. User can switch between the effects (original, gray scale, portraitMode) by clicking mouse button.There is a portrait mode effect which focuses on the face of the middle dog and blurs every other pat of the image. This effect has specific calculations for the provided image (dogs.jpg) only. This image can be found in June7 folder in my github repository by the name of dogs.jpg. Note: If the user simply want to blur the image, they can do that by removing the if condition in line 64.

In creating the portraitMode() function, I referenced the Blur program example from the Processing official [website](https://processing.org/examples/blur.html).
