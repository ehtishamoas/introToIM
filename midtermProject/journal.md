## Penguin Rush

### Game Description:
Penguine Rush would be a 2D platform game where a player character (a penguin) can be controlled using arrow keys. The player's target would be to move around the map and collect fishes while avoiding the seals and traps. This idea is inspired by the summer heat these days, and of course my love for the penguins.

### Progress:

#### June 8: 
I have gathered all the assets required for the game like penguin sprites, platform images, background images, and sounds etc.  
Now, I will also start working on the initial version of the code.
