## Penguin Rush

### Game Description:
Penguine Rush would be a 2D platform game where a player character (a penguin) can be controlled using arrow keys. The player target would be to move around and collect fishes while avoiding the seals and traps.

### Progress:

#### June 8: 
I have gathered all the assets required for the game like penguin sprites, platform images, background images, and sounds etc.  
Now, I will also start working on the initial version of the code.
