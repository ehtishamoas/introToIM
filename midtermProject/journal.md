## Penguin Rush

### Game Description:
Penguine Rush would be a 2D platform game where a player character (a penguin) can be controlled using arrow keys. The player's target would be to move around the map and collect fishes while avoiding the seals and traps. This idea is inspired by the summer heat these days, and of course my love for the penguins.

### Progress:

#### June 8: 
I have gathered all the assets required for the game like penguin sprites, platform images, background images, and sounds etc.  
I have also started working on the initial structure of the code.

#### June 9:
I have created gameCharacters class where I included all the important attributes and methods like gravity, update, and display. Then, I created two subclasses one for enemies (seals) and one for the player character (penguin) and inherited both of these classes from the gameCharacters class. I have also created a platform class which wll be used to create blocks where the penguin would be able to stand and move by jumping on it.

My next goal is to create the 'game' class where I will create ArrayLists of enemies and platforms and will decide on gameover and restart etc.
