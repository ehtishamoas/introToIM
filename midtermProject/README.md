### Game Description:
Penguine Rush is a 2D platform game where a player controls a penguin using Left, Right, and Up arrow keys to steer it on the screen.  
The player's target is to move towards the right to explore the map and finish the level by entering an igloo while also collecting the fishes to increase the score and avoiding the seals and the ice spikes, colliding with which results in game over.  
The map is made by snow-themed background images, platforms, and different objects like trees and snowmen. Player can make the penguin jump and land on different platforms to collect the fishes and avoid the seals and ice spikes.  
The background music and sound effects for certain occassions (like jump, fish collection, level completion, and game over) are also included in the game.
