## Penguin Rush

### Game Description:
Penguine Rush is a 2D platform game where a player controls a penguin using Left, Right, and Up arrow keys to steer it on the screen.  
The player's target is to move towards the right to explore the map and collect the fishes to increase the score while also avoiding the seals and the traps.  
The map is made by snow-themed background images, platforms and tiles. Player can make the penguin jump and land on different platforms to collect the fishes and avoid the seals and traps.  
The game includes a good background music and also uses good sound effects for certain occassions (like collecting a fish or eliminating a seal).


### Gameplay Instructions:
Player can increase their score by collecting the fishes.  
If the penguin collides with any of the seals sideways, or if it falls under any trap, the game would be over.  
Player can eliminate the seals by landing on their heads after jumping. However, eliminating the seals will not increase the score.  
Once the game is over, the player will be able to restart the game by clicking on the screen.
