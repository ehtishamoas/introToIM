## Final Project Proposal:

### Main Idea Description:
I plan to create a football free-kick game where the player will use servo motor with kicking mechanism will be used to kick the ball with an objective to do a goal. 

Using processing, player will be instructed to place the ball on the marked location on the field made of cardboard. The servo motor will be placed inside cardboard in such a way that player can adjust its location by sliding it. 

Then, player will be asked to press a keyboard button to indicate that he/she is ready to take a shot. Then player will have limited time to take a shot and hit the goal.

If the ball goes inside goal within that time, the ultrasonic sensor will detect the ball and player will be awarded a point. Otherwise, player will lose a try.

Player will have three lives before the game overs. The high score will be placed inside a file, which will be updated at the end of each game where the player crosses a high score. 

The game difficulty can be changed by placing more or less players on the field to stop/prevent the ball to reach the goal.

#### Arduino:
Servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, LED lights, and buzzer will be used.

#### Processing:
Images, sounds, text, and file will be used.



### Backup idea Description:
In case I do not get access to the materials needed for my main project idea due to covid-related restrictions in my area, I will start working on my backup idea for the final project.

The idea is to create an endless 2D top-down game where the player will drive the ship in the sea.
The goal of the game would be to steer the ship while avoiding the obstacles in the sea and travel as long as possible to set up high score.

#### Arduino:
Two switches will be used to steer the ship.
Player will be able to increase or decrease the speed of the ship using potentiometer.
Green LED will light as the ship is alive and moving and Red LED lights upon game over.
Piezo buzzer will be used to make the sound when the ship crash.

#### Processing:
The game will require the use of Images, sounds, animations, and text.
