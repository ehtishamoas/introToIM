## Final Project Proposal:

#### Description of idea:
I plan to create an endless 2D top-down game where the player will drive the ship in the sea.
The goal of the game would be to steer the ship while avoiding the obstacles in the sea and travel as long as possible to set up high score.

#### Arduino:
Two switches will be used to steer the ship.
Player will be able to increase or decrease the speed of the ship using potentiometer.
Green LED will light as the ship is alive and moving and Red LED lights upon game over.
Piezo buzzer will be used to make the sound when the ship crash.

#### Processing:
The game will require the use of Images, sounds, animations, and text.
