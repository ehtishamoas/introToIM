## Final Project:

### Proposal:
I plan to create a football free-kick game where the player will use servo motor with a small shoe attached will be used to kick the ball with an objective to hit the goal. 

Using processing, player will be instructed to place the ball on the marked location on the field made of cardboard. The servo motor will be placed inside cardboard in such a way that the player can adjust its location by sliding it.

The player will also be instructed to set the field as per shown on the screen.

Then, the player will be asked to press the a certain keyboard button to indicate that he/she is ready to take a shot. The player will then have limited time to take a shot (using a certain keyboard button) and hit the goal after he/she presses the ready button.

If the ball goes inside goal within that time, the ultrasonic sensor will detect the ball and player will be awarded a point. Otherwise, player will lose one try.

Player will have three tries before the game overs. The high score will be placed inside a file, which will be updated at the end of each game where any player crosses the high score. 

The game difficulty can be changed by placing more or less players on the field to stop/prevent the ball to reach the goal.

#### Arduino:
The project will require servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, LED lights, and a buzzer.

#### Processing:
The project will use images, sounds, text, and file.

### July 2, 2021:

Today I purchased a small ball and model making sheet to be used as the field and pasted a green colored chart paper on it.

Then, I cut 3 boundries from the model making sheet and pasted it on the field. At first I was thinking of using cardoard but the ball does not rebound well from it.

I also made 4 legs for the table by combining many straws.

Furthermore, I bought a shoe shaped keychain, removed the chain from it, and hooked it with the servo motor.

Here is the picture of the material and the progress I made today:

### July 3, 2021:

Today I created a goal using small net and some paper straws. I also created a hole in the goal place where the ball will fall and detected by the ultrasonic sensor.

I also found the servo motor's speed to be very low. So, I decided to use the dc motor instead. Now player can use up and down arrow keys to adjust the position of foot and then use the spacebar to kick the ball.

Next thing I plan on doing is to use servo motor to adjust the horizontal position of the foot. Then, I will draw a semi circle on which the player can set the ball anywhere. Combining this mechanism will provide much greater interactivity to the player and make the game more strategic for the player (especially when there will be fielders on the ground).
