### Difficulties faced:

I found it quite difficult to choose the coordinates values to accurately draw lines and ellipses to represent arms, legs, and eyes etc. I had to try many different combinations of coordinates until I could reach the suitable values. I wanted to draw somewhat realisic hands and was progressing in the right direction using a combination of arcs, but it was too much work as I needed to figure out coordinates and suitable arc shapes.
