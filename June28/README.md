### Pong with Arduino:

#### Description:
I have created a simple pong game where the player's goal is to keep the ball(s) on the screen using movable bar. In this game, player can control the bar using two switches, blue switch for left movement and yellow switch for right movement.

When a player is able to prevent the ball from going down using movable bar, green led on arduino blinks. When the game overs, red LED on arduino lights up until the game is restarted by the player by clicking on the screen.

The game is implemented using object oriented programming, so the player can increase the difficulty of the game by adding as many balls as they want.

#### Here is the screenshots of the game:

#### An interesting thing about this project:
The game background and colors are determined using LDR. If player is playing the game in dark, the dark theme comes up where the backgrond is black and the ball and the walls are white. However, if the player is playing in light, the light theme comes up where the backgrond is white and the ball and the walls are black.
