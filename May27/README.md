### Interesting things I discovered:

At first I wanted to make boxes within box kind of pattern and I found out that 'scale' is the function I needed. Then I used 'translate' and 'rectMode' functions to help me make that pattern. But when I tried to put in some animations by using 'rotate' function, I found out that the 'rotate' function combined with the 'scale' function actually gives a very nice optical illusion effect.
